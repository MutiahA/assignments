Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
My project is on a cake blog. I tried as much as possible to incorprorate all the requirements into the project.
Requirements
1. I linked 6 different html pages. 5 connected to each cake recipes
   and the other(index1.html) linked to "GO" at the bottom of the page.
2. My website has one ordered list
3. It also has 2 stylesheet files per html file:
   One SCSS file and a stylesheet file from bootstrap as requested.
4. Images in the assignment folder are images used for the website.
5. Index0.css is the original css stylesheet
6. Index.scss is the scss stlyesheet with a corresponding css file(Index.css).
7. Bootstrap columns1 component was used.
8. !important property was used so that all subsequent rules on an element are to be 
ignored, and the rule denoted by !important is to be applied.
9. About, home and contact and index html files are corresponding files linked to the navigation bar where:
	home.html = home page
	about.html = about blogger page
	contact.html = contact us page
	index.html = Blog post page
